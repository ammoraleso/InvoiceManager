# Task:

Design and implement a CRUD application using Java or Kotlin that manages invoices and their corresponding line items. The application should:

- **Create**: Allow users to generate new invoices and add multiple line items to each Invoice. Each line item should include details like item description and price.
- **Read**: Enable users to view and search existing invoices, along with their associated line items.
- **Update**: Add line item(s) to an existing invoice.
- **Delete**: operation is not needed.

The application should also allow users to pay for invoices. This feature should include the following functionalities:
- **Paying the Invoice**: Invoice can be marked as paid with relevant information pertaining to the payment persisted.

Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to represent invoices and line items, and choose a suitable storage mechanism to persist the data. Implement an API to interact with the application and perform aforementioned operations.

## Additional Notes
